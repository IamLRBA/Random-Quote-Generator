Overview:

The Random Quote Generator is a simple web app that displays a randomly selected quote every time the user clicks a button. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice DOM manipulation, API fetching, and social media integration, while showcasing an aesthetically pleasing design and smooth user experience. Users can also share their favorite quotes directly on Twitter with a single click.

Features:

    -Displays random quotes plus its author from a predefined list or fetched from an external API.
    -Allows users to get a new quote by clicking a button.
    -Twitter Integration: Users can share the current quote directly to Twitter with a "Tweet" button.
    -Responsive and modern design, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
    -Easy to understand code structure, making it a beginner-friendly project.

How It Works:

    -When the page loads, a random quote is displayed.
    -Users can click the "New Quote" button to generate another random quote.
    -Users can also click the "Tweet" button to post the displayed quote directly to their Twitter account.
    -Quotes can either be hardcoded into the project or fetched dynamically from a quotes API.
    -The app uses JavaScript to handle the logic, DOM manipulation, and Twitter integration for sharing quotes.
